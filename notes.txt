Making sure the user can only try to match one number...

1. user selects a dice, turning it green, that number is saved as the current game number
2. If user unselects that dice, the current game number is reset to null
2a. for this to work, I need to know the value that is set and the id of the dice that set it
3. From that point on, only dice that match the current game number can be selected, otherwise they will turn red for a
second, with a message saying 'that is not the current game numer', before turning white again
